## Overview

- The IoT device uses two photoresistors and a humidity & temperature sensor (DHT11)
- The IoT device will transmit measurements to a web application so that users can monitor their homes. It will use a simulated clock for this project.
- The web application uses responsive design to allow users to view the application seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- The web application should have a navigation menu.
- The web application should use a responsive design to be viewable on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The web application should have the index.html page to introduce your team and your project.
- The web application should have the `reference.html` page to list your third-party APIS, libraries, and code.
