| 4 | AWS running | 1 | Cannot access: 0 point (Your server should be running during 12/13 - 12/17) |  |
| 5 | Localhost running | 1 | 0 point if I am not able to run your localhost on my laptop:<br>(SHOULD present how to run your localhost in README) | [ ] |
| 6 | Particle running | 1 | 0 point if I am not able to run a particle device using your provided code<br>(SHOULD present how to run your localhost in README) | [ ] |
| 7 | Sign in/ Sign up | 0.5 | 0 point if I am not able to create my account or I am not able to use your test account<br>Should provide your test account (i.e., ID and password in README) | [ ] |
| 8 | Device registration | 1 | 0 point if I am not able to register my device or cannot see how to setup webhook on your device registration page | [ ] |
| 9 | Responsive pages | 1 | Should support mobile devices for Index.html, sign-in, sign-out, and control panel | [ ] |
| 10 | Simulated clock | 1 | Your particle device should operate at least 1Hz<br>You should use your own simulated clock on your AWS | [ ] |
| 11 | Weather information display | 1 | 0 point if I cannot see this weather information using your web app<br>(You should use third party API and display weather information) | [ ] |
| 12 | Thermostat operation | 2 | ECE 513:<br>Should support on (auto mode)/off, off/Cool/Heat, and temperature setting with hysteresis for your auto mode<br>I will use my device to verify your implementation<br>Based on temperature captured by DHT 11, your thermostat should run or stop your A/C or heater. <br>Should clearly present your A/C or heater status (e.g., run or stop) for both localhost and web app | [ ] |
| 13 | WiFi Temperature & Humidity Sensor operation | 2 | Should start/stop collecting data using your web app<br>Should store your measurement data on your database<br>Minimum requirement: collect data every 10 minutes (simulated clock) <br>(i.e., 1 sec in device = 10 minutes in AWS) | [ ] |
| 14 | Smart bulb operation | 2 | ECE 513:<br>Should control your bulb for on/off, manual/auto, color using localhost app<br>Should control your bulb For on/off, manual/auto, color, bedtime, wake-up using web app<br>I will use my device to verify your implementation | [ ] |
| 15 | Door status simulation | 1 | Should display the door status on localhost app and web app<br>Should display any kind of alerts when the door state is "open" for a while <br>(e.g., when a user click a button to check whether the door alert is generated or not, <br>your app should display the corresponding information) | [ ] |
| 16 | Temperature & humidity monitoring dashboard | 2 | Should display 24 hours history and daily history<br>I will use your test account to see 24 hours history and daily history (at least 7days)<br>Also, I will use my device to check whether your system supports new device or not | [ ] |
| 17 | Power consumption simulation | 2 | ECE 513 only:<br>Should display daily usage and weekly usage<br>Should include your power consumption related code in your particle firmware <br>(e.g., use power state machine for your thermostat with a/c and heater)<br>I will use your test account to see daily usage and weekly usage (at least 3 weeks)<br>Also, I will use my device to check whether your system supports new device or not | [ ] |
| 18 | HTTPS | 2.5 | Extra credit for both ECE 413 and 513 | [ ] |
| 20 | Late submission |  | -1 point / 2 hours (e.g., If you submit at 6AM on 12/13, your max. points should be 17 not 20)<br>Allow < 1 hour delay (e.g., no penalties if you submit by 12/13 12:59AM)<br>After 40 hours from 11:59 PM, 12/12, I will not accept any late submissions | [ ] |
